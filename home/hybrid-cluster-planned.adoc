=== Performance Comparison

==== Single-Core Performance
- **Mac Mini Advantage**: The M2’s high single-threaded performance makes it ideal for tasks like OCR pipelines, scientific calculations, and bursty web services.
- **Intel N305 Limitation**: While capable, its efficient cores cannot match the M2’s performance in single-threaded scenarios.

==== Multi-Core Performance
- **Intel N305 Advantage**: Its 8 E-cores provide strong parallel processing capabilities for lightweight, multi-threaded workloads like containerized applications and distributed services.
- **Mac Mini Limitation**: The hybrid architecture (4 P-cores + 4 E-cores) offers solid performance but at a higher cost for scaling to memory- or storage-intensive tasks.

=== Use Cases
- **N305 Nodes**:
  - Best for general-purpose workloads, databases, and memory-intensive applications.
  - Scalable and cost-effective.
- **Mac Minis**:
  - Ideal for specialized tasks requiring high single-threaded performance or ARM optimizations.
  - Power-efficient for sustained use in environments with constrained power budgets.

== Hybrid Server Setup: N305 and Mac Mini

=== Rationale for a Hybrid Setup
- Combining **N305 nodes** with **Mac Minis** allows leveraging the strengths of both architectures:
  - N305 excels in parallel workloads and cost efficiency.
  - Mac Mini (M1/M2) provides strong single-threaded performance and energy efficiency.

== Phased Plan for Kubernetes Cluster Deployment

=== Phase 1: Core Kubernetes Cluster
- **Nodes**: 3 N305 nodes (1 control plane + 2 worker nodes).
- **Focus**:
  - Establish a standard Kubernetes cluster.
  - Deploy general-purpose workloads.
  - Experiment with container orchestration, scaling, and fault tolerance.

=== Phase 2: Add M1 Mac Mini
- **Setup**:
  - Integrate the existing M1 Mac Mini as a worker node.
  - Install **Linux (e.g., AlmaLinux)** or use macOS for ARM-specific workloads.
  - Label the M1 node (`hardware=arm64`) to schedule ARM-compatible workloads.
- **Focus**:
  - Test multi-architecture container builds (`amd64` and `arm64`).
  - Validate the M1’s performance for specialized tasks.

=== Phase 3: Expand with M2 Mac Minis
- **Setup**:
  - Add 2 M2 Mac Minis to the cluster.
  - Reserve them for CPU-intensive tasks or lightweight services requiring high single-thread performance.
- **Focus**:
  - Explore scheduling workloads across heterogeneous nodes.
  - Test resource allocation using taints, tolerations, and affinity rules.

=== Phase 4: Scale with Additional N305 Node
- **Setup**:
  - Add a fourth N305 node to expand x86 compute capacity.
- **Focus**:
  - Compare ARM and x86 performance.
  - Simulate larger-scale workload distribution and hybrid cloud scenarios.

== Advanced Experimentation
- **Multi-Architecture Containers**:
  - Build and deploy containers compatible with both ARM and x86 architectures.
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Use taints, tolerations, and affinity rules to allocate tasks based on node capabilities.
- **Failure Scenarios**:
  - Test node failure handling in a heterogeneous environment.
- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Measure single-threaded vs. multi-threaded performance across different node types.

== Conclusion
This phased approach allows for building a scalable, heterogeneous Kubernetes cluster that balances cost, performance, and flexibility. Starting with the N305 nodes ensures a solid foundation, while adding Mac Minis introduces specialized capabilities for advanced workloads. The setup serves as a robust platform for experimentation and real-world workload simulation.
